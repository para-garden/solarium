# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in the solarium repository.

## Project Overview

Self-contained works across any medium — each built around a single premise, complete in itself, made for the sake of making it.

Part of [para-garden](https://github.com/para-garden).

## Origin

**Why it exists:** A creative practice with a single constraint — each piece is self-contained and complete. No shared universe, no ongoing world, no accumulated narrative debt. The premise is the whole justification. The discipline: pick a premise, exhaust it, ship it, move on.

**Prior art that shaped it:** Heinlein's "All You Zombies" (written in one sitting, every element load-bearing, closes perfectly) — the one-sitting constraint as a forcing function. I, Robot — self-contained pieces that accumulate without connecting. Greg Egan — premise-driven, medium varies per piece, no shared universe.

**Key design decisions:**
- Medium-agnostic: text, interactive, visual, audio — whatever serves the premise
- Each piece is an island: no piece is load-bearing for any other
- Not experimental in the "let's see what happens" sense — made with intention, finished with intention
- The site is a neutral host, not an opinionated container

**Name:** solarium — a warm domestic room where things exist because the light is good. Not a greenhouse (too industrial, things grown for a purpose), not a nursery (things that will grow into something else). Just a pleasant room.

**Org:** para-garden — creative works, not infrastructure.

## Architecture

<!-- Project-specific architecture notes -->

## Development

```bash
nix develop        # Enter dev shell
cargo test         # Run tests
cargo clippy       # Lint
cd docs && bun dev # Local docs
```

If a tool appears missing, you are outside `nix develop`. Do not assume the tool is unavailable to the project.

## Workflow

Batch checks to minimize round-trips:
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

After editing multiple files, run the full check once. `cargo fmt` runs in the pre-commit hook.

When the same change spans multiple crates, edit all files first, then build once.

`normalize view` gives structural outlines without pulling full file bodies into context:
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>
```

## Commit Convention

Conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`. Scope is optional but recommended for multi-crate repos.

## Ecosystem Design Principles

Cross-cutting principles distilled from the ecosystem's own decisions (synthesized in `docs/decisions/throughlines.md`). Apply them when building new repos and recording decisions. (Already-encoded principles — independent-tools / no-path-deps, the delegation model, CLAUDE.md-as-control-surface — live in their own sections and are not repeated here.)

- **Prefer data over code at every seam.** Serializable AST / struct / JSON over closures, embedded DSLs, or source text — so artifacts cache, replay, transport, and diff.
- **Library-first; projection-from-one-definition.** The typed library is the source of truth; CLI / HTTP / MCP / WebSocket / JSON surfaces are generated projections, never hand-rolled per surface.
- **Capability security.** Hosts grant pre-opened handles; code only attenuates what it is given; nothing forges authority; allow-list over deny-list.
- **The LLM is an oracle at the leaves, never the control loop.** Determinism is a hard invariant: seeded RNG, event-log replay, build-time-only inference. Per-query LLM in the hot loop is a defect.
- **Trust comes from verifiable evidence, not authority.** Verbatim snippets, pinned-commit permalinks, claim→node citation — never a bare reference.
- **Retire, don't deprecate; collapse asymmetries to primitives.** Remove backward-compat aliases rather than carry them; reduce N special cases to their irreducible primitives.
- **Validate against reality; tests are the spec.** Load-bearing substrates are validated against real corpora; fixtures and tests define correctness, not aspirational specs.

## Hard Constraints

- No `--no-verify`. Fix the issue or fix the hook.
- No path dependencies in `Cargo.toml` — they couple repos and break independent publishing.
- No interactive git (no `git rebase -i`, no `git add -i`, no `--no-edit` on rebase).
- No suggesting project names. LLMs are bad at this; refine the conceptual space only.
- No tracking cross-project issues in conversation — they go in TODO.md in the affected repo.
- No ecosystem changes without checking all affected repos.
- No assuming a tool is missing without checking `nix develop`.
- Commit completed work in the same turn it finishes. Uncommitted work is lost work.

## Meta

- Something unexpected is a signal. Stop and find out why. Do not accept the anomaly and proceed.
- Corrections from the user are conversation, not material for new rules. Rules are added when a failure mode is observed repeatedly.
