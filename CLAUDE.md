# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in the solarium repository.

## Project Overview

Self-contained works across any medium — each built around a single premise, complete in itself, made for the sake of making it.

Part of [para-garden](https://github.com/para-garden).

## Origin

**Why it exists:** A creative practice with a single constraint — each piece is self-contained and complete. No shared universe, no ongoing world, no accumulated narrative debt. The premise is the whole justification. The discipline: pick a premise, exhaust it, ship it, move on.

**Prior art that shaped it:** Heinlein's "All You Zombies" (written in one sitting, every element load-bearing, closes perfectly) — the one-sitting constraint as a forcing function. I, Robot — self-contained pieces that accumulate without connecting. Greg Egan — premise-driven, medium varies per piece, no shared universe.

**Key design decisions:**
- Medium-agnostic: text, interactive, visual, audio — whatever serves the premise
- Each piece is an island: no piece is load-bearing for any other
- Not experimental in the "let's see what happens" sense — made with intention, finished with intention
- The site is a neutral host, not an opinionated container

**Name:** solarium — a warm domestic room where things exist because the light is good. Not a greenhouse (too industrial, things grown for a purpose), not a nursery (things that will grow into something else). Just a pleasant room.

**Org:** para-garden — creative works, not infrastructure.

## Architecture

<!-- Project-specific architecture notes -->

## Development

```bash
nix develop        # Enter dev shell
cargo test         # Run tests
cargo clippy       # Lint
cd docs && bun dev # Local docs
```

## Core Rules

**docs/ reflects current architecture, not historical architecture.** When code changes, docs/ changes with it — in the same commit. New pages go in the sidebar immediately. The code and docs are one artifact.

**Note things down immediately — no deferral:**
- Problems, tech debt, issues → TODO.md now, in the same response
- Design decisions, key insights → docs/ or CLAUDE.md
- Future/deferred scope → TODO.md **before** writing any code, not after
- **Every observed problem → TODO.md. No exceptions.** Code comments and conversation mentions are not tracked items. If you write a TODO comment in source, the next action is to open TODO.md and write the entry.

**Conversation is not memory.** Anything said in chat evaporates at session end. If it implies a future behavior change, write it to CLAUDE.md immediately — or it will not happen.

**Warning — these phrases mean something needs to be written down right now:**
- "I won't do X again" / "I'll remember to..." / "I've learned that..."
- "Next time I'll..." / "From now on I'll..."
- Any acknowledgement of a recurring error without a corresponding CLAUDE.md edit

**Triggers:** User corrects you, 2+ failed attempts, "aha" moment, framework quirk discovered → document before proceeding.

**When the user corrects you:** Ask what rule would have prevented this, and write it before proceeding. **"The rule exists, I just didn't follow it" is never the diagnosis** — a rule that doesn't prevent the failure it describes is incomplete; fix the rule, not your behavior.

**Corrections are documentation lag, not model failure.** When the same mistake recurs, the fix is writing the invariant down — not repeating the correction. Every correction that doesn't produce a CLAUDE.md edit will happen again. Exception: during active design, corrections are the work itself — don't prematurely document a design that hasn't settled yet.

**Something unexpected is a signal, not noise.** Surprising output, anomalous numbers, files containing what they shouldn't — stop and ask why before continuing. Don't accept anomalies and move on.

**Do the work properly.** Don't leave workarounds or hacks undocumented. When asked to analyze X, actually read X — don't synthesize from conversation.

## Design Principles

**Unify, don't multiply.** One interface for multiple cases > separate interfaces. Plugin systems > hardcoded switches.

**Simplicity over cleverness.** HashMap > inventory crate. OnceLock > lazy_static. Functions > traits until you need the trait. Use ecosystem tooling over hand-rolling.

**Explicit over implicit.** Log when skipping. Show what's at stake before refusing.

**Separate niche from shared.** Don't bloat shared config with feature-specific data. Use separate files for specialized data.

## Workflow

**Batch cargo commands** to minimize round-trips:
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test
```
After editing multiple files, run the full check once — not after each edit. Formatting is handled automatically by the pre-commit hook (`cargo fmt`).

**When making the same change across multiple crates**, edit all files first, then build once.

**Minimize file churn.** When editing a file, read it once, plan all changes, and apply them in one pass. Avoid read-edit-build-fail-read-fix cycles by thinking through the complete change before starting.

**`normalize view` is available** for structural outlines of files and directories:
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>    # outline with line numbers
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>     # directory structure
```

**Always commit completed work.** After tests pass, commit immediately — don't wait to be asked. When a plan has multiple phases, commit after each phase passes. Do not accumulate changes across phases. Uncommitted work is lost work.

## Context Management

**All exploration runs in subagents.** Any tool call whose purpose is "find out what's here" — grep, find, broad reads, surveys, audits — belongs in a subagent. Raw exploratory output in the main context is active context poisoning: it lingers in cache, shapes downstream reasoning, can't be unsent. The subagent returns a distilled summary; the noise stays out.

Inline tool use in the main context is reserved for:
- Reading a known file at a known path
- Edits/writes you're committing to
- A single targeted lookup whose result you'll act on immediately

If you find yourself running a second grep to refine the first, you should have spawned a subagent. Mechanical work across many files → parallel subagents.

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types:
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `chore` - Maintenance (deps, CI, etc.)
- `test` - Adding or updating tests

Scope is optional but recommended for multi-crate repos.

## Negative Constraints

Do not:
- Announce actions ("I will now...") - just do them
- Leave work uncommitted
- Use interactive git commands (`git add -p`, `git add -i`, `git rebase -i`) — these block on stdin and hang in non-interactive shells; stage files by name instead
- Use path dependencies in Cargo.toml - causes clippy to stash changes across repos
- Use `--no-verify` - fix the issue or fix the hook
- Assume tools are missing - check if `nix develop` is available for the right environment
